## ADR-004: Modular Processing Stages Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: [Team/Individual]

### Context

We needed an architecture for the feature processing pipeline that would:
- Allow independent development of different processing stages
- Enable easy testing and debugging of individual components
- Support different processing strategies and algorithms
- Facilitate future extensibility

### Decision

We implemented a modular processing stages architecture with separate modules for:
- Feature refinement (`refine_feature.py`)
- Estimation (`estimate.py`) 
- JIRA draft generation (`draft_jiras.py`)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent testing and development
- Easy to add new processing stages
- Simplified debugging and error handling
- Flexible processing pipeline configuration

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in orchestration
- Potential for interface mismatches between stages
- Need for careful data flow management

**Neutral:**
- Requires good documentation of stage interfaces
- Need for integration testing across stages

## ADR-005: JIRA Integration via MCP Tools

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: [Team/Individual]

### Context

We needed to integrate with JIRA for ticket creation and management. Options considered:
- Direct JIRA API integration
- Third-party JIRA libraries
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools
- Webhook-based integration

### Decision

We implemented JIRA integration using Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools pattern, compatible with Llama Stack's tool ecosystem.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent with Llama Stack tool architecture
- Reusable tool pattern for other integrations
- Server-side and client-side execution options
- Built-in support for tool discovery and execution

**Negative:**
- More complex than direct API integration
- Dependency on MCP protocol specifications
- Additional abstraction layer

**Neutral:**
- Need to maintain MCP tool interfaces
- Documentation should explain MCP integration patterns

## ADR-006: Prompt Template Management

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Deciders**: [Team/Individual]

### Context

We needed a way to manage AI prompts that would:
- Enable consistent AI interactions
- Allow easy prompt iteration and testing
- Support different prompt strategies
- Facilitate collaboration on prompt development

### Decision

We implemented a file-based prompt template system in the `prompts/` directory with structured markdown files.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Version-controlled prompt templates
- Easy to review and iterate on prompts
- Clear separation between code and prompts
- Enables A/B testing of different prompts

**Negative:**
- Manual synchronization between code and prompt files
- No built-in prompt versioning or rollback
- Potential for prompt/code interface mismatches

**Neutral:**
- Need for prompt template validation
- Documentation should include prompt development guidelines
