# Manual Model Stop/Restart Capability for KServe in OpenShift AI

**RFE ID:** RHOAIRFE-390
**Category:** Model Serving
**Priority:** Critical
**Complexity:** Medium

## Description

Enable OpenShift AI users to manually stop and restart served models in KServe without deleting the model definition. This feature addresses the lack of intuitive model lifecycle control, providing users with the ability to temporarily halt model serving while preserving configurations for future restart.

## Business Justification

Organizations deploying multiple large language models (LLMs) and other resource-intensive models need precise control over model lifecycle to optimize resource utilization and respond to operational requirements. Current KServe behavior lacks intuitive stop/start capabilities that existed in ModelMesh, creating operational gaps and user confusion.

### Critical Use Cases Driving This Request:

- **Emergency Model Shutdown**: Immediately stop problematic models without full deletion when issues are discovered
- **Resource Optimization**: Manage limited GPU resources across multiple models (e.g., 5 LLMs with only 2 GPUs available)
- **Scheduled Operations**: Enable automated weekend shutdowns for cost optimization across all projects
- **Development Workflows**: Start/stop models during testing and validation cycles
- **Capacity Management**: Prevent resource contention during high-demand periods

### Current Problem Statement:

The existing KServe "zero replica" option creates counterintuitive behavior:
1. Setting replicas to zero creates a new model generation requiring full pod startup
2. Users must have sufficient resources to create new pods before old ones terminate
3. Auto-scaling still allows request-triggered restarts, preventing true shutdown
4. Complex generation management makes troubleshooting difficult
5. Direct pod deletion worsens the situation by triggering more pods

This results in:
- **Resource Waste**: Temporary resource doubling during generation transitions
- **User Confusion**: Unexpected behavior compared to ModelMesh experience
- **Operational Friction**: No reliable way to achieve true model shutdown
- **Support Burden**: Complex troubleshooting when users attempt manual interventions

## Technical Requirements

### P0 Requirements (Must Have)

#### 1. True Model Stop Functionality
- **Capability**: Complete cessation of model serving with zero running pods
- **Scope**: Both KServe standard and raw deployment modes
- **Guarantee**: No automatic restart on incoming requests when explicitly stopped
- **Resource Release**: Immediate GPU and memory resource release upon stop

#### 2. Preserved Model Configuration
- **State Management**: Model definition and configuration retained during stop
- **Restart Capability**: Full restart from preserved configuration without re-specification
- **Version Consistency**: No generation increment for stop/start operations
- **Metadata Preservation**: All model metadata, endpoints, and settings maintained

#### 3. API-First Implementation
- **REST API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/models/{model-name}/stop` - Stop model serving
  - `POST /api/v1/models/{model-name}/start` - Resume model serving
  - `GET /api/v1/models/{model-name}/status` - Get current lifecycle state
- **Status Reporting**: Clear distinction between "stopped", "running", "starting", "stopping" states

### P1 Requirements (Should Have)

#### 6. Advanced Stop Options
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Configurable grace period for in-flight request completion
- **Forced Shutdown**: Immediate termination option for emergency scenarios

- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated shutdown policies (weekend schedules, resource limits)
- **Override Capabilities**: Admin override of user stop/start actions when needed
- **Audit Logging**: Complete lifecycle event logging for compliance

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Services
- **Model Lifecycle Controller**: New Kubernetes controller for true stop/start semantics
