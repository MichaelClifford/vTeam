  # System Architecture Guidelines

  ## Architectural Patterns
  - Layered architecture principles
  - Domain-driven design (DDD)
  - Event sourcing and CQRS
  - Hexagonal architecture
  - Service mesh implementation

  ## System Design Principles
  - Scalability and performance considerations
  - Security architecture and threat modeling
  - Integration patterns and API gateways
  - Data architecture and storage strategies
  - Observability and monitoring design

  ## Technology Selection
  - Technology stack evaluation criteria
  - Cloud vs on-premise considerations
  - Open source vs proprietary solutions
  - Performance and cost optimization
  - Maintenance and support considerations
