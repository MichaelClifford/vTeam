# Task: Create Jira Tickets Structure from RHOAI Feature Documentation

## Objective
Analyze the provided RHOAI feature document and create a comprehensive structure of Jira tickets that would be needed to implement the feature. This includes epics, stories, tasks, and their relationships.

## Step-by-Step Process
1. **Analyze Input Document**: Understand the feature scope, requirements, and delivery plan
2. **Identify Epic Structure**: Break down the feature into logical epics based on teams and components
3. **Create Detailed Tickets**: Generate specific implementable tickets for each epic
4. **Define Relationships**: Establish parent-child and dependency relationships between tickets

## Soft Mode Instructions
Generate ticket structures in **soft mode** - do NOT create actual Jira tickets. Instead, define the complete ticket structure with:
- Ticket title and detailed description
- Epic/Story/Task/Bug classifications
- Acceptance Criteria using standard Acceptance Criteria Format: "Given [scenario], when [action performed],Then [expected state]"
- Parent-child relationships, including assigning appropriate Feature Jira Issues as Parent issue
- Cross-ticket dependencies, using following dependency types:
  * Blocks / is blocked byOutward Description: Blocks – The source issue prevents the destination issue from starting or completing.
Inward Description: Is blocked by – The destination issue cannot proceed until the source issue is resolved. Use Case: Commonly used for process dependencies where one task must be completed before another can start (e.g., a "Finish-to-Start" dependency).
  * Relates to / relates toOutward Description: Relates to – The source issue has a general relationship with the destination issue. Inward Description: Relates to – The destination issue is related to the source issue. Use Case: Used for loose associations where issues are connected but not necessarily dependent (e.g., for context or shared relevance). This link type may not always indicate a strict dependency, so use it cautiously for dependency management.  
- Component assignments using component teams listed in Ticket Sizing: Team Average Duration Per Story Point
- Story point estimates using ticket sizing guidelines:
  * decompose into child user stories or tasks ensuring that each is appropriately sized for completion within a three-week sprint and using Average Duration per story point for componenet specific size estimation.
  * Story points are in Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13.
  * Story points do not exactly reflect the time the ticket will take, but reflect more the complexity of the ticket and overall effort required. If the ticket is 8 or 13, consider dividing it into smaller tickets.
- For Feature estimation, the points of all child tickets shall be added up to provide a Feature story point estimate which will be combined with implementation plan timeline.
- Priority levels
- upstream open source applicability
- tech debt identification
- detailed test steps
- required documentation
