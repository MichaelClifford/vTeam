## Examples

Here are examples of well-written RHOAI refinement documents:

### Example 1: Data Science Pipeline Integration

```markdown
# RHOAI Feature Refinement - Data Science Pipeline Integration

| RHOAI Feature Refinement |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [RHOAI-456] Feature Summary: *Integrate Kubeflow Pipelines with RHOAI data science projects* Feature Owner/PM: *Sarah Chen* Delivery Owner: *Mike Rodriguez* RFE Council Reviewer: *Alex Thompson*  | **Refinement Status** | Generated |  |
|  | **Slack channel or thread for discussions** | #forum-openshift-ai-pipelines |  |

# **Feature Overview**

Enable data scientists to create, manage, and execute ML pipelines directly within RHOAI workbenches. Users can design pipelines using a visual interface, version control pipeline definitions, and monitor execution across the OpenShift cluster. This bridges the gap between experimentation and production deployment.

## **The Why**

Current data scientists must manually orchestrate ML workflows, leading to inconsistent deployments and difficulty scaling models to production. This feature will reduce time-to-production by 60% and ensure reproducible ML workflows, making RHOAI competitive with Databricks and AWS SageMaker.

## **High level requirements**

1. Visual pipeline designer integrated into RHOAI dashboard
2. Pipeline versioning and Git integration
3. Automated model deployment from pipeline outputs
4. Resource scheduling and optimization for pipeline steps
5. Pipeline monitoring and alerting

## **Non-functional requirements**

* **Performance parameters**: Support 100+ concurrent pipeline executions
* **Security concerns**: Pipeline isolation, RBAC integration with OpenShift
* **Disconnected needs**: Offline pipeline execution capability
* **User expectations**: Sub-5 minute pipeline startup time

## **Out of scope**

- Custom pipeline step authoring (use existing containers only)
- Integration with external orchestration tools (Airflow, etc.)
- Real-time streaming pipelines

## **Feature level Dependencies**

- Kubeflow Pipelines upstream integration
- OpenShift Service Mesh for pipeline networking
- RHOAI Model Registry for artifact management

### **Will this feature require bringing in new upstream projects or sub-projects into the product?**

Yes - Kubeflow Pipelines v2.0 SDK and Tekton integration

### **Will this feature require onboarding of a new container Image or Component?**

Yes - Pipeline execution engine containers and SDK images

### **Will this feature require user-facing documentation?**

Yes - Comprehensive documentation including tutorials and API reference

### **Will this feature require UX design?**

Yes - Visual pipeline designer interface requires extensive UX work

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can create pipelines with 5+ steps using visual interface
- Pipeline execution logs are accessible within RHOAI dashboard
- Failed pipelines provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
- Pipeline artifacts integrate with RHOAI Model Registry
- Performance meets SLA: 95% of pipelines complete within expected timeframes

## **High Level Delivery Plan**

| Team | Sprint Start Availability | Work to Deliver | Dependencies | T-Shirt Size | Comments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Platform (Required)** | Sprint 24.2 | Kubeflow integration, cluster config | Upstream approval | L | Platform impact assessment complete |
| **Dashboard Team** | Sprint 24.3 | Visual pipeline designer UI | UX designs | M | Requires new React components |
| **Backend Team** | Sprint 24.2 | Pipeline API, execution engine | Platform work | M | REST API and database schema |
```

### Example 2: Model Serving Optimization

```markdown
# RHOAI Feature Refinement - Multi-Model Serving Optimization

| RHOAI Feature Refinement |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| [RHOAI-789] Feature Summary: *Optimize resource usage for serving multiple ML models* Feature Owner/PM: *David Kim* Delivery Owner: *Lisa Wang* RFE Council Reviewer: *TBD*  | **Refinement Status** | Generated |  |
|  | **Slack channel or thread for discussions** | #forum-openshift-ai-serving |  |
|  | **Date created** | 2024-03-20 |  |

# **Feature Overview**

Enable efficient resource sharing when serving multiple ML models by implementing dynamic batching, model caching, and intelligent resource allocation. Users can deploy multiple models on shared infrastructure with automatic scaling based on demand.

## **The Why**

Current model serving requires dedicated resources per model, leading to 70% resource waste and high infrastructure costs. This optimization will reduce serving costs by 50% while improving response times through intelligent batching and caching.

## **High level requirements**

1. Dynamic request batching across multiple models
2. Intelligent model caching with LRU eviction
3. Automatic resource scaling based on model demand
4. Request routing optimization
5. Cost and performance monitoring dashboard

## **Non-functional requirements**

* **Performance parameters**: <100ms latency increase with batching
* **Security concerns**: Model isolation, secure multi-tenancy
* **Disconnected needs**: Works with edge deployments
* **User expectations**: Zero-downtime model updates

## **Out of scope**

- Cross-cloud model serving
- Custom inference frameworks beyond supported ones
- Real-time model retraining

## **Feature level Dependencies**

- KServe optimization APIs
- Prometheus metrics integration
- OpenShift resource quotas

### **Will this feature require bringing in new upstream projects or sub-projects into the product?**

No - uses existing KServe and Istio components

### **Will this feature require onboarding of a new container Image or Component?**

Yes - Optimized serving runtime containers

### **Will this feature require user-facing documentation?**

Yes - Configuration guides and best practices documentation

### **Will this feature require UX design?**

Yes - Resource utilization dashboard requires UX design

## **Acceptance Criteria**

- Multiple models can share resources with <10% performance degradation
- Resource utilization improves by 40% compared to dedicated serving
- Dashboard shows real-time resource usage and cost metrics
- Model updates complete without request failures
- Automatic scaling responds to load changes within 30 seconds

## **High Level Delivery Plan**

| Team | Sprint Start Availability | Work to Deliver | Dependencies | T-Shirt Size | Comments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Platform (Required)** | Sprint 24.1 | Resource optimization, KServe config | None | S | Minimal platform changes |
| **Serving Team** | Sprint 24.1 | Batching logic, caching implementation | Platform work | M | Core optimization algorithms |
| **Dashboard Team** | Sprint 24.2 | Monitoring dashboard | UX designs, backend APIs | S | Extend existing dashboards |
