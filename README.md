# RAT (Refinement Agent Team) System

> AI-powered automation system to reduce engineering refinement time and improve ticket quality

## Overview

The Refinement Agent Team (RAT) system is an evolutionary AI automation solution that dramatically reduces the time engineering teams spend in refinement meetings. By automatically preparing Jira tickets with comprehensive context, detailed breakdowns, and clear acceptance criteria, RAT enables engineering teams to start work immediately with well-refined tickets.

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams currently spend excessive time in refinement meetings due to:
- Poorly prepared tickets lacking necessary context
- Missing detailed feature breakdowns  
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Disconnected information across RFEs, code repositories, and architectural documents

## Solution

RAT addresses these challenges through intelligent automation that:
- **Coalesces information** from multiple data sources (RFEs, code repos, ADRs)
- **Generates detailed feature breakdowns** with all necessary attributes
- **Prepares tickets for cold-start execution** by engineering teams
- **Works within existing agile frameworks** as an evolutionary improvement

## Success Metrics

- üéØ **90% ticket readiness** for immediate engineering execution
- ‚è±Ô∏è **50% reduction** in refinement meeting duration
- üöÄ **25% improvement** in engineering velocity
- üìä **Measurable time savings** in refinement hours per ticket

## System Architecture

RAT employs a microservices-based architecture with event-driven communication:

- **Technology Stack**: Python/FastAPI services, Redis task queuing, PostgreSQL data storage
- **Integration Points**: Jira API, Git repositories, ADR systems, RFE databases
- **Performance Target**: Handle 100+ tickets per day processing
- **Security**: Secure access to enterprise data sources
- **Scalability**: Support multiple teams and projects simultaneously

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Ticket Preparation**: Automatically enriches tickets with context from multiple data sources
- **Agent-Based Processing**: Specialized AI agents handle different aspects of refinement
- **Jira Integration**: Seamless workflow integration with existing processes  
- **Data Source Connectivity**: Links to RFEs, repositories, architectural decision records
- **Automated Workflow**: Event-driven processing with minimal manual intervention
